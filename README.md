## Hi there üëã

Here you'll find my collection of achievements from Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, discovered zero-day vulnerabilities, and certifications. Feel free to explore and take a look around!

I like to keep my personal notes separate, which you can find in my [BookOfTomFoolery](https://github.com/k00l-beanz/BookOfTomFoolery) üìì. I also store scripts and resources there.

Enjoy your stay!
